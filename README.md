* Potential divider to adjust brightness
* Potential divider to adjust speed

## Software

* Button press changes to next effect
* Use EEPROM to save effect as default, either by:
   * long button press?
   * some seconds after change, save?
* Here's the trickly one: smooth transition between effects
